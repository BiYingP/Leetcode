# First Bad Version

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest vesion of your products fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous vesion, all the versions after a bad veesion are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1,2,...,n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.


Example

Input: n = 5, bad = 4

Output: 4

Explanation:

call isBadVersion(3) -> false

call isBadVersion(5) -> true

call isBadVersion(4) -> true

then 4 is the first bad version.


/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      
	boolean isBadVersion(int version); */


    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = n;
        while(left <= right){
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid)){
                right = mid - 1;    
            }
            else{
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
