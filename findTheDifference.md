Find the Difference

You are given two string s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffing string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"

Output: "e"

Explanation: "e" is the letter that was added.

Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"

Output: "y"



    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) { 
        
        int i = 0;
        int res = 0;
        
        while (i < s.length()){
            res += t.charAt(i) - s.charAt(i);
            i++;
        }
        res += t.charAt(i);
        return (char) res;
    }
