// Determine if Two Strings are Close

// Two string are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

// Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
// 	For Example, abcde -> aecdb

// Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character. 
// 	For Example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's)

// You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

// Given two strings, word1 and word2, return true if word1 and word2 are close, and false otherwise.

// Example 1:
// Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"
// Output: true
// Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations
// Operation 1: "abc" -> "acb"
// Operation 2: "acb" -> "bca"
